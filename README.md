This project is team **Regen Retire**'s EthDenver buidlathon project. At its core, it is based on the Opolis bounty "Crypto Retirement". From there, additional bounties were added to support feature richness and quick development. We are a team of two.

## Design Philosophy
**Regen Retire** wanted to take a fresh look at retirement planners availble online from TradFi providers. We wanted to allow a user to plan not only for retirement, but also for a regenerative break in the much nearer future. This particular sabbatical-like planning could be for web3 builders who take on short term projects. We intentionally don't ask for personally identifiable information like age or salary.
